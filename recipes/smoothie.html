        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>For this mango glass of tropical deliciousness, we are keeping things as simple as possible with just three ingredients.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mango</li>
            <li>Greek youghurt</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and dice the mango, then set it on a plate and freeze for about 30 minutes. This will help it chill, which will contribute to the frosty consistency of the smoothie. Alternatively, you can use pre-frozen mango pieces (these are often more affordable).</li>
            <li>Blend all of the ingredients in a blender until everything is smooth and mixed together.</li>

            <p>Enjoy!</p>
        </ol>
