        <p>When life gives you lemons, make the Best Lemonade Ever!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar and water</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Juice your lemons.</strong> Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. This will help release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise, then squeeze out the juice by hand or with a juicer.
                Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have.</li>
            <li><strong>Make a simple syrup. </strong>It is shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir. </strong>Pour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste.</li>    
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
        </ol>
